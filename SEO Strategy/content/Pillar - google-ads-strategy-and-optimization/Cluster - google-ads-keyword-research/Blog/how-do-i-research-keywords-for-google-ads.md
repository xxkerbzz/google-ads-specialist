# How Do I Research Keywords for Google Ads?

## Topic Foundation

Keyword research is the foundation of effective Google Ads campaigns. Learning how to research keywords helps you identify the search terms your potential customers use, allowing you to create campaigns that target the right searches and generate qualified leads.

## How Do I Research Keywords for Google Ads?

Start by brainstorming keywords based on your services, location, and customer needs. Think about how customers describe their problems and what they're searching for. For a plumbing business, this might include keywords like "leaky faucet repair" or "drain cleaning near me."

Use keyword research tools to identify additional keywords, see search volume, and understand competition. Google's Keyword Planner is a good starting point, providing search volume and competition data. Other tools like SEMrush, Ahrefs, and Ubersuggest offer additional insights.

Look at your competitors' ads and websites to see what keywords they're targeting. This can help you identify opportunities and understand the competitive landscape. However, don't just copy competitors—find your own opportunities based on your unique strengths.

Analyze search intent to understand what customers are looking for. Are they looking for information, comparing options, or ready to buy? Match your keywords and ad copy to the search intent to improve relevance and conversion rates.

## What Tools Should I Use for Keyword Research?

Google Keyword Planner is a good starting point for keyword research. It provides search volume, competition data, and cost estimates. You can enter seed keywords related to your services and get suggestions for related keywords.

Other tools like SEMrush, Ahrefs, and Ubersuggest offer additional insights beyond what Keyword Planner provides. These tools can show you what keywords competitors are targeting, identify content gaps, and provide more detailed competition analysis.

Many service businesses also use Google's autocomplete feature and related searches to identify keywords. When you type a search into Google, it suggests related searches that can give you ideas for keywords to target.

Don't forget to look at your own website analytics and search console data. These can show you what keywords are already bringing traffic to your site, which can inform your Google Ads keyword selection.

## What Makes a Good Keyword for Service Businesses?

Good keywords for service businesses are specific, include local modifiers, and indicate clear customer intent. Keywords like "emergency plumber near me" or "HVAC repair [city]" are better than generic keywords like "plumber" because they target customers who are ready to take action.

Specific keywords help you avoid wasting budget on irrelevant clicks. Instead of targeting "plumber," target "emergency plumber" or "drain cleaning service." These specific keywords attract customers with clear needs who are more likely to convert.

Local keywords are crucial for service businesses because customers typically search for services in their area. Include location modifiers like your city name or "near me" to target customers in your service area and improve lead quality.

Keywords that indicate clear intent are more likely to generate qualified leads. Emergency keywords like "AC not working" indicate urgent need, while installation keywords like "new HVAC system" indicate planning ahead. Match your keywords to customer intent.

## How Do I Organize Keywords into Ad Groups?

Organize keywords into themed ad groups based on service type, customer intent, or geographic area. This allows you to create targeted ad copy and landing pages for each group, improving relevance and conversion rates.

Create separate ad groups for different service types. For example, a plumbing business might have separate ad groups for "drain cleaning," "water heater repair," and "emergency plumbing." This allows for more targeted ad copy that speaks directly to each service.

Group keywords by customer intent, such as emergency versus routine maintenance. Emergency keywords require different ad copy than maintenance keywords, so separating them allows for better messaging that matches customer needs.

For service businesses with multiple locations, create separate ad groups or campaigns for each location. This allows you to customize ad copy and landing pages for each area, improving relevance and performance.

## How Do I Know If My Keywords Are Working?

Monitor key metrics like click-through rate, cost per click, conversion rate, and cost per lead. Keywords that generate clicks but no conversions may be too broad or irrelevant. Keywords that generate leads at a reasonable cost are working well.

Track which keywords generate actual leads versus just clicks. You might find that some keywords generate many clicks but few leads, while others generate fewer clicks but more qualified leads. Focus your budget on keywords that generate leads.

Compare keyword performance over time to identify trends. Some keywords might perform better during certain seasons or times of year. Adjust your keyword strategy based on performance data to improve results.

Use negative keywords to exclude irrelevant searches and reduce wasted spend. If you only serve residential customers, add "commercial" as a negative keyword to avoid showing ads for commercial searches that won't convert.

## Knowledge Synthesis

Researching keywords for Google Ads starts with brainstorming keywords based on your services and customer needs, then using tools like Google Keyword Planner to identify additional keywords and analyze search volume and competition. Good keywords for service businesses are specific, include local modifiers, and indicate clear customer intent. Organize keywords into themed ad groups and monitor performance to identify what's working and what needs adjustment.
