# Google Ads Keyword Research: Complete Guide

Google Ads keyword research involves identifying search terms your target customers use, analyzing search volume and competition, and selecting keywords that align with your business goals and conversion objectives.

## What Is Google Ads Keyword Research?

Google Ads keyword research is the process of identifying the search terms your potential customers use when looking for your services. These keywords become the foundation of your campaigns, determining when and where your ads appear.

Effective keyword research helps you target the right searches, avoid wasting budget on irrelevant keywords, and create ad copy that matches what customers are searching for. It's the foundation of successful Google Ads campaigns.

For service businesses, keyword research involves understanding how customers describe their problems and what they're searching for. A plumbing business might target keywords like "leaky faucet repair" or "drain cleaning near me," while an HVAC company might target "AC not working" or "furnace repair."

Keyword research also involves analyzing search volume, competition, and cost to identify opportunities. You want keywords with good search volume and reasonable competition that align with your services and budget.

## Why Keyword Research Matters

Keyword research matters because it determines who sees your ads and how relevant your ads are to their searches. Targeting the wrong keywords means your ads appear to people who aren't interested in your services, wasting your budget.

Good keyword research helps you understand your target customers' search behavior. This understanding informs everything from ad copy to landing pages, helping you create campaigns that resonate with your audience.

Keyword research also helps you identify opportunities you might not have considered. You might discover new service areas, customer pain points, or ways customers describe your services that you hadn't thought of.

For service businesses, keyword research is particularly important because customers use specific terms when searching for services. Understanding these terms helps you target customers at the right moment with the right message.

## How to Research Keywords

Start by brainstorming keywords based on your services, location, and customer needs. Think about how customers describe their problems and what they're searching for. List all the terms that come to mind, then expand from there.

Use keyword research tools to identify additional keywords, see search volume, and understand competition. Google's Keyword Planner is a good starting point, but there are many other tools available that provide additional insights.

Look at your competitors' ads and websites to see what keywords they're targeting. This can help you identify opportunities and understand the competitive landscape. However, don't just copy competitors—find your own opportunities.

Analyze search intent to understand what customers are looking for. Are they looking for information, comparing options, or ready to buy? Match your keywords and ad copy to the search intent to improve relevance and conversion rates.

Focus on local keywords that include your service area, as these are more likely to generate qualified leads. Include location modifiers like your city name or "near me" to target customers in your service area.

## Selecting the Right Keywords

Selecting the right keywords involves balancing search volume, competition, cost, and relevance. You want keywords with good search volume and reasonable competition that align with your services and budget.

Focus on keywords that match your services and customer needs. Avoid broad keywords that might attract unqualified clicks, and focus on specific keywords that indicate clear intent. For example, "emergency plumber" is better than just "plumber."

Consider keyword match types when selecting keywords. Broad match reaches the most people but may include irrelevant searches. Exact match is most precise but reaches fewer people. Phrase match and modified broad match offer a balance.

For service businesses, include local modifiers in your keywords to target customers in your service area. Keywords like "plumber near me" or "HVAC repair [city]" are more likely to generate qualified leads than generic keywords.

Organize keywords into themed ad groups based on service type, customer intent, or geographic area. This allows you to create targeted ad copy and landing pages for each group, improving relevance and conversion rates.

## Organizing Keywords

Organizing keywords into themed ad groups helps you create targeted ad copy and landing pages, improving relevance and conversion rates. Group keywords by service type, customer intent, or geographic area.

Create separate ad groups for different service types. For example, a plumbing business might have separate ad groups for "drain cleaning," "water heater repair," and "emergency plumbing." This allows for more targeted ad copy.

Group keywords by customer intent, such as emergency versus routine maintenance. Emergency keywords require different ad copy than maintenance keywords, so separating them allows for better messaging.

For service businesses with multiple locations, create separate ad groups or campaigns for each location. This allows you to customize ad copy and landing pages for each area, improving relevance and performance.

Use negative keywords to exclude irrelevant searches and reduce wasted spend. For example, if you only serve residential customers, add "commercial" as a negative keyword to avoid showing ads for commercial searches.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How many keywords should I target?

There's no magic number, but most service businesses start with 20-50 keywords per service type. Focus on quality over quantity—target keywords that align with your services and customer needs rather than trying to target everything.

### Should I target broad or specific keywords?

For service businesses, specific keywords typically perform better because they indicate clear intent. However, a mix of both can work well. Start with specific keywords, then test broader keywords if you want to expand reach.

### How do I know if my keywords are working?

Monitor key metrics like click-through rate, cost per click, conversion rate, and cost per lead. Keywords that generate clicks but no conversions may be too broad or irrelevant. Keywords that generate leads at a reasonable cost are working well.
