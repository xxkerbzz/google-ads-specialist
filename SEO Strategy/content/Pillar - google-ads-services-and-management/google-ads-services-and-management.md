# Google Ads Services and Management: Complete Guide

Google Ads services and management involves professional campaign setup, optimization, and ongoing management of search ads, local service ads, and remarketing campaigns to generate qualified leads.

## What Is Google Ads Management?

Google Ads management is the professional service of setting up, optimizing, and maintaining Google Ads campaigns on behalf of businesses. Instead of managing campaigns yourself, a Google Ads specialist or agency handles the day-to-day work of running your campaigns.

Management services typically include keyword research, ad copywriting, bid management, performance monitoring, and ongoing optimization. The goal is to generate more qualified leads at a lower cost per lead than you could achieve managing campaigns yourself.

Professional Google Ads management is particularly valuable for service businesses because it requires expertise, time, and staying current with platform changes. Most service business owners find that hiring a specialist pays for itself through better results and time savings.

Management services can be provided by agencies, freelancers, or specialized consultants. The key is finding someone with experience in your industry who understands your unique needs and can deliver measurable results.

## Google Search Ads Management

Google Search Ads management involves professional setup and ongoing optimization of search campaigns. This includes keyword research to identify the terms your potential customers use, ad copywriting to create compelling ads, and bid management to maximize ROI.

Search ads management also includes ongoing optimization activities like testing different ad copy variations, adjusting keyword bids based on performance, adding negative keywords to reduce wasted spend, and optimizing landing pages for better conversion rates.

A good search ads manager will provide regular reporting that shows how your campaigns are performing, what optimizations have been made, and what results you're seeing. This transparency helps you understand what you're paying for and how your campaigns are improving over time.

Search ads management is particularly valuable for service businesses because it requires understanding both Google Ads best practices and the unique characteristics of service business marketing. Generic management approaches often fail because they don't account for industry-specific needs.

## Local Service Ads Management

Local Service Ads (LSA) management involves professional setup and optimization of pay-per-lead advertising campaigns. LSA management includes profile setup, review management, job type configuration, and lead quality monitoring.

LSA management is different from search ads management because LSA operates on a pay-per-lead model rather than pay-per-click. This means management focuses on optimizing for lead quality and cost per lead rather than click-through rates and cost per click.

A good LSA manager will help you set up your profile correctly, optimize your job types and service areas, manage your reviews to improve ranking, and monitor lead quality to ensure you're getting qualified leads.

LSA management also includes dispute management for invalid leads, which can help protect your budget from charges for leads that don't meet Google's quality standards. This is particularly valuable for service businesses that receive many leads.

## Display Remarketing Campaigns

Display remarketing management involves professional setup and optimization of campaigns that re-engage website visitors. This includes pixel installation, audience creation, ad design, and performance optimization.

Remarketing management helps you capture leads from visitors who didn't convert on their first visit. By showing targeted ads to people who have already been to your website, you can increase the likelihood they'll return and become customers.

A good remarketing manager will help you create strategic audience segments, design effective display ads, set appropriate frequency caps to avoid ad fatigue, and optimize campaigns for better performance over time.

Remarketing management is particularly valuable for service businesses because it helps you capture leads from visitors who were interested but didn't take action immediately. This can significantly improve your overall lead generation and ROI.

## Google Ads Account Management

Google Ads account management involves comprehensive oversight of your entire Google Ads account, including multiple campaign types, budget allocation, and strategic planning. This is a higher-level service that goes beyond individual campaign management.

Account management includes strategic planning to align your Google Ads campaigns with your business goals, budget allocation across different campaign types, and coordination of multiple campaigns to avoid conflicts or wasted spend.

A good account manager will provide strategic guidance on which campaign types to use, how to allocate your budget, and how to structure your account for optimal performance. They'll also coordinate between different campaigns to ensure everything works together effectively.

Account management is particularly valuable for service businesses running multiple campaign types or working with larger budgets. It ensures all your campaigns are working together toward your business goals rather than competing against each other.

## Choosing the Right Management Service

Choosing the right Google Ads management service requires understanding your needs, budget, and goals. Consider factors like industry experience, service offerings, pricing structure, and communication style.

Look for a management service with experience in your specific industry. Service businesses have unique needs that generic agencies may not understand. Industry-specific expertise can make a significant difference in campaign performance.

Consider what services are included in the management fee. Some services include everything, while others charge extra for services like landing page optimization or conversion tracking setup. Make sure you understand what's included and what costs extra.

Evaluate the pricing structure to ensure it aligns with your budget and goals. Some services charge a flat monthly fee, while others charge a percentage of ad spend. Consider which structure works better for your situation.

Communication style is also important. You want a management service that communicates regularly, explains what they're doing, and responds to your questions promptly. Good communication helps ensure you're getting value from the service.
